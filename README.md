ðŸ‘‹  Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Julie Wang. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a rising third year at Northeastern University studying Computer Science with a minor in Psychology.

ðŸ’¡ I'm interested in learning more about user-centered development, whether that be UI/UX design or front-end development! I have experience in Java, Python, JavaScipt, Node.JS, and I'm always looking to learn more!
