👋  Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Julie Wang. 

🌱 I’m currently a rising third year at Northeastern University studying Computer Science with a minor in Psychology.

💡 I'm interested in learning more about user-centered development, whether that be UI/UX design or front-end development! I have experience in Java, Python, JavaScript, Node.JS, and I'm always looking to learn more!

📫  Looking forward to connecting with you via Linkedin or my email! (wang.julie@northeastern.edu)
